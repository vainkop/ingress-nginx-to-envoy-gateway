# ClusterIssuer for cert-manager with Gateway API http01 solver
#
# This is the Gateway API equivalent of the ingress-nginx ClusterIssuer.
# Instead of using spec.acme.solvers[].http01.ingress.ingressClassName,
# it uses spec.acme.solvers[].http01.gatewayHTTPRoute to solve ACME challenges
# via the Gateway's HTTP listener.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. cert-manager must have Gateway API support enabled:
#    In cert-manager Helm values: config.enableGatewayAPI: true
#    (NOT the deprecated --feature-gates=ExperimentalGatewayAPISupport=true)
# 2. cert-manager pods must be restarted after enabling Gateway API support
#    so they pick up the new RBAC for Gateway/HTTPRoute resources.
# 3. The Gateway must have an HTTP listener on port 80 with allowedRoutes from: All
#    so cert-manager can create temporary HTTPRoutes for challenges.
