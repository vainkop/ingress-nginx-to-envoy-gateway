# GatewayClass for Envoy Gateway
#
# This is the cluster-scoped resource that tells Kubernetes which controller
# manages Gateways of this class. Only one GatewayClass per controller is needed.
#
# The parametersRef links to an EnvoyProxy resource for custom proxy configuration
# (replicas, access logs, node placement, etc.).
#
# Apply this AFTER Envoy Gateway CRDs and controller are installed.
